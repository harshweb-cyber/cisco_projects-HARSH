#Simple-Networking
Design a Network in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Case Study and Requirements:

    Design a network in Cisco Packet Tracer to connect ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments through the following:
    Each department should contain at least two PCs.
    An appropriate number of switches and routers should be used in the network.
    Using the given network 192.168.40.0, all interfaces sould be configured with correct IP addresses, subnet mask and gateways.
    All devices in the network should be connected using appropriate cables.
    Test communication between devices in both ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments.


Technologies Implemented:-

    Creating a Simple Network using a Router and Access Layer Switch.
    Connecting Networking devices with Correct cabling.
    Connecting two Networks using a Router.
    Subnetting and IP Addressing.
    Assigning IP Addresses to Router's interfaces.
    Static IP Address allocation to Host Devices.
    Test and Verifying Network Communication.
